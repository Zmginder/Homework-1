Data Scientists work with large and many times messy data that can be structured or unstructured.\n\nHow do you view yourself in relation to these two areas?\nI do view myself as more of a statistician than a data scientist.\n\n\n\nCode\nUtilizing the iris data set, the first code chunk saves the density of the Petal Width data as “y.” Then analysis is performed on the “y” to determine its class, type, and structure.\n\n#Store the data\ny &lt;- density(iris$Petal.Width)\n\n#Determine class, type, and structure of y\ncat(\"The class of y:\", class(y),\"\\n\")\n\nThe class of y: density \n\ncat(\"The data y is of the type:\", typeof(y),\"\\n\")\n\nThe data y is of the type: list \n\ncat(\"The following is the structure of y: \\n\")\n\nThe following is the structure of y: \n\nstr(y)\n\nList of 8\n $ x         : num [1:512] -0.656 -0.648 -0.64 -0.633 -0.625 ...\n $ y         : num [1:512] 0.00161 0.00178 0.00197 0.00217 0.00239 ...\n $ bw        : num 0.252\n $ n         : int 150\n $ old.coords: logi FALSE\n $ call      : language density.default(x = iris$Petal.Width)\n $ data.name : chr \"iris$Petal.Width\"\n $ has.na    : logi FALSE\n - attr(*, \"class\")= chr \"density\"\n\n\nThe second code chunk shows the plot of the density of the Petal Width data from the iris data set."
